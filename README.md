## Project Description

This will be a very simple, very granular budgeting tool. It will try to be as comprehensive and specific as possible. There will also be plenty of options to skip chunks or just put your best, broad estimation if you would prefer. For maximum privacy it is suggested the code be downloaded to your private computer or phone and all the information simply stored locally with log-in disabled, however the deploy will authenticate individual users so it can be used remotely. Even remotely I will set it up as multiple users in case more than one person in a household wants to use it, or even if a person has some reason to have separate budgets. On the mobile breakdown, I will make it as easy as possible to add in a quick purchase with a note which will either default to "sundries" or be held to be sorted later.

Currently it is planned to support income taxes in the United States and it's states and territories. There will be an option for someone to manually enter local income tax rates if different.

DISCLAIMER: This app was made by some guy. It is not a professional budgeting tool. He is a very fine man but he is not an economist, in fact he's not especially good at math. Do not rely on this app in any way, shape, or form, and do not hold him liable if you budget using this app and then lose all of your money. He's done the best job he can do but that isn't very good.

Further, a note on security. This is literally the first app this bloke has ever written entirely on his own. Security is absolutely basic, and he personally will have access to any information you choose to store remotely. He won't look and he doesn't care but technically the option will be there, and anyone who knows more coding than he does could prolly get access, which is most people who have taken CS courses. If you download the code to a private computer and run it locally you should be able to store the data in a secure manner, or if you're that good you can even find a way to host it more securely and use it across multiple devices. But just want you to know that absolutely no guarantees can be made about the sanctity of the data stored via the link above. So just don't sue me.

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

## API and Data Sample

Do research into if there is an API with individual tax rates for the various states.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP

- Calculate income, determine which portion is to be taxed.
- Accurately reduce it by state and local tax.
- Reduce take-home pay by regular necessities and luxuries.

#### PostMVP

- Plan savings for specific purchases.
- More robust debt calculation.
- Project future for general accounts and specific saving plans

## What I plan to learn

In order to complete this project, I will learn how to create modals, and also how to make this app something I can download onto my phone and run there. I imagine some sort of icon work might also be involved. I suspect I'll discover that I'll have to do this differently from scratch to actually run it on the phone, like writing it in kotlin rather than JS.
