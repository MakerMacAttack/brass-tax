## Project Description

This will be a very simple, very granular budgeting tool. It will try to be as comprehensive and specific as possible. There will also be plenty of options to skip chunks or just put your best, broad estimation if you would prefer. For maximum privacy it is suggested the code be downloaded to your private computer or phone and all the information simply stored locally with log-in disabled, however the deploy will authenticate individual users so it can be used remotely.

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.
