# Project Overview

## Brass Tax

Link eventually here.

## Project Description

This will be a very simple, very granular budgeting tool. It will try to be as comprehensive and specific as possible. There will also be plenty of options to skip chunks or just put your best, broad estimation if you would prefer. For maximum privacy it is suggested the code be downloaded to your private computer or phone and all the information simply stored locally with log-in disabled, however the deploy will authenticate individual users so it can be used remotely. Even remotely I will set it up as multiple users in case more than one person in a household wants to use it, or even if a person has some reason to have separate budgets. On the mobile breakdown, I will make it as easy as possible to add in a quick purchase with a note which will either default to "sundries" or be held to be sorted later.

Currently it is planned to support income taxes in the United States and it's states and territories. There will be an option for someone to manually enter local income tax rates if different.

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

## API and Data Sample

Do research into if there is an API with individual tax rates for the various states.

### MVP/PostMVP 

#### MVP 

- Calculate income, determine which portion is to be taxed.
- Accurately reduce it by state and local tax.
- Reduce take-home pay by regular necessities and luxuries.

#### PostMVP  

- Plan savings for specific purchases.
- More robust debt calculation.

## What I plan to learn

In order to complete this project, I will learn how to create modals, and also how to make this app something I can download onto my phone and run there. I imagine some sort of icon work might also be involved. I suspect I'll discover that I'll have to do this differently from scratch to actually run it on the phone, like writing it in kotlin rather than JS.
